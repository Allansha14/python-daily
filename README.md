Explanation
List Initialization: The list of numbers is defined as [3, 5, 7, 9, 2].
Set Initial Max Value: The variable max is set to 0. If all elements in the list are negative, this approach might not work as expected, but for positive numbers, itâ€™s fine.
Loop Through List: Each element of the list is compared with max. If an element is larger, max is updated.
Result: After looping, max holds the maximum value, which is printed.
